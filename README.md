# Journal
##3.21.15
Worked on a few examples from chapter 3 of eloquent js and one of the exercises. Definitely hit 1.5 hour goal.

##3.22.15
Learning: Don't worry about efficiency until you are sure the program is too slow.
Learning: What makes closures special is they allow pre-programmed versions of existing functions to be called with different values. They help you create multiple versions of existing functions really.
Learning: Functions can call other functions that are declared in the global scope.

Completed all the exercises from chapter 3 and started on chapter 4. Got to page 67 while working a precision grind. Starting to learn about objects and how to calculate correlation. May come back to this tonight.

##3.23.15
Completed over 45 minutes of work today. Worked on chapter 4 of Eloquent Javascript.  Definitely struggling to understand everything we did with objects and arrays. Got a bit nervous because of the correlation formula, should return to this chapter and these concepts. Got to page 74, section "The arguments object".
